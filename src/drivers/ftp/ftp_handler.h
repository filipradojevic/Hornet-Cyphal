/**
 * @file    ftp_handler.h
 * @brief   FTP protocol operation handlers for MAVLink file transfer service.
 *
 * This header defines the API for handling MAVLink FTP commands related to
 * file and directory management on LittleFS-based storage. It includes
 * function prototypes for processing FTP opcodes such as file open, read,
 * write, create, remove, rename, directory listing, session management,
 * CRC calculations, and burst reads.
 *
 * The handlers parse incoming FTP messages, perform filesystem operations,
 * manage FTP sessions, and prepare appropriate FTP responses.
 *
 * These functions enable reliable, efficient file transfers and remote
 * filesystem manipulation over the MAVLink protocol.
